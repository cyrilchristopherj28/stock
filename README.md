To use this website, simply open the homepage and enter a company name in the input box (for the demo, try typing Reliance or Tata). Once you click the Get Score button, the site will instantly display the company’s overall credit score along with a color-coded score card (green for good, yellow for moderate, red for risky). You will also see a bar chart showing how different factors such as debt, volatility, and sentiment influenced the score. Below the chart, recent news headlines related to the company are listed, each tagged as positive or negative to explain how external events are affecting the company’s score. This simple flow helps you quickly understand not just the score, but also the reasons behind it.
